# Angular Pipe Replace Domain Images

Creation of a pipe for the substitution of images with relative routes, for absolute routes.

The example is very useful for cases where you are consulting a REST API (for example in Drupal) and it returns the images with relative paths.

This example could also be used to replace any text string with another.

## How to use

Run `git clone https://github.com/julenmelgar/angular-pipe-replace-domain.git`.

Run `npm install`.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
